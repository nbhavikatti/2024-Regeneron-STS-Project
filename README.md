# cache
Cache code - includes cache function. This project for Regeneron STS 2023 is about finding lower bounds of algorithms like matrix matrix multiplication and LU factorization for the many different cache
policies (LRU, LFU, Explicit, etc.). Note that copy.c is O(1) cache simulator, while main is the O(M) cache simulator.
